                <a href="https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC23-tokens/tree/Recommended#erc23-token-standard">ERC223</a></b>.</p>

                <p>Current token BananaCoin 1.0 was ERC20 standard, which is ok for minimal functions (send and store), but don't have additional one, like transparent buy-back of the tokens.</p>

                <p>We added these function, so right now all buy-back is automatic.</p>
                </p>
