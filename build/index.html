        the Pike." We are professionals in our business and we know how to make a successfull banana business. Secondly,
        attracting money through the ICO does not give investors a share in business, it is a financial instrument, after
        fulfilling obligations on which the business will remain in the hands of the team. Third, the BananaCoin project
        for us is the start of a future large-scale project, we want to go through the business that we understand to
        pass the "fire of water and copper pipes" ICO in order to approach the new project in Lao PDR with the already
        successful case.</div>
